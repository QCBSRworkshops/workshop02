# RStudio Projects

What is this?

1.  Projects make it easy to keep your work organized.
2.  All files, scripts, documentation related to a specific project are
    bound together with a .Rproj file

Encourages reproducibility and easy sharing

## Create a new project

Use the **Create project** command (available in the Projects menu and
the global toolbar)

## Keep your files organized

One project = one folder

Place similar files inside of their own folders

Keep track of versions

## Preparing data for R

-   Datasets should be stored as **comma separated files (.csv)** in
    Data folder.
-   comma separated files (.csv) can be created from almost all
    applications (Excel, LibreOffice, GoogleDocs)
-   file -\> save as .csv

### Naming files

-   Good:
    -   rawDatasetAgo2017.csv
    -   co2_concentrations_QB.csv
    -   01_figIntro.R
-   Bad:
    -   final.csv *(Uninformative!)*
    -   safnnejs.csv *(Random!)*
    -   1-4.csv *(Avoid using numbers!)*
    -   Dont.separate.names.with.dots.csv *(Can lead to reading file
        errors!)*

### Naming variables

-   Use short informative titles (i.e. "Time_1" not "First time
    measurement")
    -   Good: "Measurements", "SpeciesNames", "Site"
    -   Bad: "a", "3", "supercomplicatedverylongname"
-   Column values must match their intended use

### Common data preparation mistakes

-   No text in numeric columns
-   Do not include spaces!
-   NA (not available) can be used for missing values, and blank entries
    will automatically be replaced with NA
-   Name your variables informatively
-   **Look for typos!**
-   Avoid numeric values for data that do not have a numeric meaning
    (i.e. subject, replicate, treatment)
    -   For example, if subjects are "1,2,3" change to "A,B,C" or
        "S1,S2,S3"
-   Use CONSISTENT formats for dates, numbers, metrics, etc.
-   Do not include notes, additional headings, or merged cells!
-   One variable per column!

### Bad data examples

It is possible to do all your data preparation work within R. This has
several benefits:

-   Saves time for large datasets
-   Keeps original data intact
-   Keeps track of the manipulation and transformation you did
-   Can switch between long and wide format data very easily (more on
    this later and in workshop 4)
