# Loading, exploring and saving data

### Working directory

R needs to know the directory where your data and files are stored in
order to load them. You can see which directory you are currently
working in by using the `getwd()` command.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
getwd() # This commands shows the directory you are currently working in
```

When you load a script, R automatically sets the working directory to
the folder containing the script.

To change working directories using the `setwd()` function, specify the
working directory's path using a "/" to separate folders, subfolders
and file names. You can also click Session \> Set working directory \>
Choose directory...

### Display the content of the working directory

The command `dir()` displays the content of the working directory.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
dir() # This command shows the content of the directory you are currently working in
```

You can check:

-   Whether or not the file you plan to open is present in the current
    directory
-   The correct spelling of the file name (*e.g.* 'myfile.csv' instead
    of 'MyFile.csv')

### Importing data

Use the `read.csv()` command to import data in R.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
CO2 <- read.csv("co2_good.csv") # Creates an object called CO2 by loading data from a file called "co2_good.csv"
```

This command specifies that you will be creating an R object named
"CO2" by reading a csv file called "co2_good.csv". This file must be
located in your current working directory.

Recall that the question mark can be used to find out what arguments the
function requires.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
?read.csv # Use the question mark to pull up the help page for a command
```

In the help file you will note that adding the argument header=TRUE
tells R that the first line of the spreadsheet contains column names and
not data.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
CO2 <- read.csv("co2_good.csv", header = TRUE)
```

NOTE: If your operating system or CSV editor is in French, you may need
to use `read.csv2()` instead of `read.csv()`

Notice that RStudio now provides information on the CO2 data in your
workspace. The workspace refers to all the objects that you create
during an R session.

### Looking at data

The CO2 dataset consists of repeated measurements of CO2 uptake from six
plants from Quebec and six plants from Mississippi at several levels of
ambient CO2 concentration. Half of the plants of each type were chilled
overnight before the experiment began.

There are some common commands that are useful to look at imported data:

  ----------------- ----------------------------------------
  CO2               Look at the whole data frame
  head(CO2)         Look at the first few rows
  tail(CO2)         Look at the last few rows
  names(CO2)        Names of the columns in the data frame
  attributes(CO2)   Attributes of the data frame
  dim(CO2)          Dimensions of the data frame
  ncol(CO2)         Number of columns
  nrow(CO2)         Number of rows
  summary(CO2)      Summary statistics
  str(CO2)          Structure of the data frame
  ----------------- ----------------------------------------

The `str()` command is very useful to check the data type/mode for each
column (i.e. to check that all factors are factors, and numeric data is
stored as an integer or numeric. There are many common problems:

-   Factors loaded as text (character) and vice versa
-   Factors including too many levels because of a typo
-   Numeric or integer data being loaded as a character due to a typo
    (including space or using a comma instead of a "." for a decimal)

**Exercise**

Try to reload the data using:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
CO2<-read.csv("co2_good.csv",header=FALSE)
```

Check the `str()` of CO2. What is wrong here? Reload the data with
header=TRUE before continuing.

### Reminder from workshop 1: Accessing data

Data within a data frame can be extracted by several means. Let's
consider a data frame called *mydata*. Use square brackets to extract
the content of a cell.

![](images/table_reminder_from_workshop_1_accessing_data.png){width="500"}

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mydata[2,3] # extracts the content of row 2 / column 3
```

If column number is omitted, the whole row is extracted.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mydata[1,] # extracts the content of the first row
```

The squared brackets can also be used recursively

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mydata[,1][2] # this extracts the second content of the first column
```

If row number is omitted, the whole column is extracted. Similarly, the
`$` sign followed by the corresponding header can be used.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mydata$Variable1 # extracts a specific column by its name ("Variable1")
```

### Renaming variables

Variable names (i.e. column names) can be changed within R.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# First let's make a copy of the dataset to play with!
CO2copy <- CO2
# names() gives you the names of the variables present in the data frame
names(CO2copy)

# Changing from English to French names (make sure you have the same levels!)
names(CO2copy) <- c("Plante","Categorie", "Traitement", "conc","absortion")
```

### Creating new variables

New variables can be easily created and populated. For example,
variables and strings can be concatenated together using the function
`paste()`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Let's create an unique id for our samples using the function paste()
# see ?paste and ?paste0
# Don't forget to use "" for strings
CO2copy$uniqueID <- paste0(CO2copy$Plante,"_", CO2copy$Categorie, "_", CO2copy$Traitement)

# Observe the results
head(CO2copy$uniqueID)
```

Creating new variables works for numbers and mathematical operations as
well!

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Let's standardize our variable "absortion" to relative values
CO2copy$absortionRel = CO2copy$absortion/max(CO2copy$absortion) # Changing to relative values

# Observe the results
head(CO2copy$absortionRel)

```

### Subsetting data

There are many ways to subset a data frame.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Let's keep working with our CO2copy data frame

## Subsetting by variable name
CO2copy[,c("Plante", "absortionRel")] # Selects only "Plante" and "absortionRel" columns. (Don't forget the ","!)

## Subsetting by row
CO2copy[1:50,] # Subset data frame from rows from 1 to 50

### Subsetting by matching with a factor level
CO2copy[CO2copy$Traitement == "nonchilled",] # Select observations matching only the nonchilled Traitement.

### Subsetting according to a numeric condition
CO2copy[CO2copy$absortion >= 20, ] # Select observations with absortion higher or equal to 20

### Conditions can be complimentary -The & (and) argument-
CO2copy[CO2copy$Traitement  == "nonchilled" & CO2copy$absortion >= 20, ]

# We are done playing with the dataset copy. Let's erase it.
CO2copy <- NULL
```

R

### Data exploration

A good way to start your data exploration is to look at some basic
statistics of your dataset using the `summary()` function.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
summary(CO2) # Get summary statistics of your dataset
```

You can also use some other functions to calculate basic statistics
about specific parts of your data frame, using `mean()`, `sd()`,
`hist()`, and `print()`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Calculate mean and standard deviation of the concentration, and assign them to new variables
meanConc <- mean(CO2$conc)
sdConc <- sd(CO2$conc)

# print() prints any given value to the R console
print(paste("the mean of concentration is:", meanConc))
print(paste("the standard deviation of concentration is:", sdConc))

# Let's plot a histogram to explore the distribution of "uptake"
hist(CO2$uptake)

# Increasing the number of bins to observe better the pattern
hist(CO2$uptake, breaks = 40)
```

The function `apply()` can be used to apply a function to multiple
columns of your data simultaneously. Use the `?apply` command to get
more information about `apply()`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
?apply
```

To use apply, you have to specify three arguments. The first argument is
the data you would like to apply the function to; the second argument is
whether you would like to calculate based on rows (1) or columns (2) of
your dataset; the third argument is the function you would like to
apply. For example:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
apply(CO2[,4:5], MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean) # Calculate mean of the two columns in the data frame that contain continuous data
```

### Save your workspace

By saving your workspace, you can save the script and the objects
currently loaded into R. If you save your workspace, you can reload all
of the objects even after you use the `rm(list=ls())` command to delete
everything in the workspace.

Use `save.image()` to save the workplace:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
save.image(file="co2_project_Data.RData") # Save workspace

rm(list=ls())  # Clears R workspace

load("co2_project_Data.RData") #Reload everything that was in your workspace

head(CO2) # Looking good! :)
```

### Exporting data

If you want to save a data file that you have created or edited in R,
you can do so using the `write.csv()` command. Note that the file will
be written into the current working directory.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
write.csv(CO2,file="co2_new.csv") # Save object CO2 to a file named co2_new.csv
```

### Use your data CHALLENGE

Try to load, explore, plot and save your own data in R. Does it load
properly? If not, try fixing it in R. Save your fixed data and then try
opening it in Excel.
